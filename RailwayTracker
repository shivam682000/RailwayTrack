RAILWAY TRACKER DOCUMENT

1. REQUIREMENTS AND INFORMATION GATHERING
GPS Module
Microcontroller
Notification sensor
Plotting graph - AWS IOT ThingSpeak
Relay circuit
Satellite services

2. DESIGN
Install GPS module in the engine of the train.
Train’s alarm system linked to the GPS.
If there is any accident then the location of the train is automatically sent to the nearest railway station and rescue team.

The GPS module should also be connected to the train’s alarm system and if there is any unexpected incident then that should be notified to the nearest railway station and also the rescue team.

4. TESTING

Unit Testing: check whether the data being received is accurate.
Integration Testing: check if the modules such as the GPS tracker and the train’s alarm system are working as expected together, 
also if the data is stored properly in the database.
System Testing: check the working of the central control system.

5. DEPLOYMENT
Continuous monitoring of all the devices and also the database is done after deployment.
